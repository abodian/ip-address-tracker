# IP Address GeoLocator


## Install

1. No need to sign up to an API. The app uses a free API with no key needed. Note: this does course a restriction when deployed live due to free version not accepting SSH but will work fine from your local machine. 

2. Cd to root
```
npm install
npm start
```

3. App opens up with your IP Address and the location/information that the IP Address API provides. You can search for IP Address locations using the search bar.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Links

- Live Site URL: [[Render Deployment](https://ip-geolocator.onrender.com/)]

NB: due to free version API restrictions, you cannot find your IP address using the live link above. It does however work from localhost without SSL restrictions.
